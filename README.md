## 🙏 Inspiration & Learning

This dashboard was inspired by @rishabhmishra (https://github.com/rishabhnmishra) and his YouTube tutorials on Excel-based data analysis. I followed his guidance to understand dashboard design and storytelling, and built my own version from scratch as a practice project to apply those concepts.

All visuals, structure, and insights in this repository reflect my personal interpretation and learning journey.
